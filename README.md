## Features

- Geolocation: The application uses the browser's geolocation API to track the user's location and display it on the map during workouts.
- Map Display: The application integrates the Leaflet library to display an interactive map. Each workout is marked as a point on the map with a custom marker.
- Workout Details: Users can view the details of each workout by clicking on the respective map marker. This includes information like distance, duration, pace, and elevation gain.
- Local Storage: The application stores workout data in the browser's local storage, allowing users to view their workouts even after refreshing the page.
